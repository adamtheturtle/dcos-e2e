Usage: minidcos aws upgrade [OPTIONS] INSTALLER_URL

  Upgrade a cluster to a given version of DC/OS.

Options:
  -c, --cluster-id TEXT           The ID of the cluster to use.  [default:
                                  default]
  -v, --verbose                   Use verbose output. Use this option multiple
                                  times for more verbose output.
  --extra-config FILE             The path to a file including DC/OS
                                  configuration YAML. The contents of this file
                                  will be added to add to a default
                                  configuration.
  --variant [oss|enterprise]      Choose the DC/OS variant. If the variant does
                                  not match the variant of the given installer
                                  URL, an error will occur.   [required]
  --aws-region TEXT               The AWS region to use.  [default: us-west-2]
  --workspace-dir DIRECTORY       Creating a cluster can use approximately 2 GB
                                  of temporary storage. Set this option to use a
                                  custom "workspace" for this temporary storage.
                                  See https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile
                                  .html#tempfile.gettempdir for details on the
                                  temporary directory location if this option is
                                  not set.
  --security-mode [disabled|permissive|strict]
                                  The security mode to use for a DC/OS
                                  Enterprise cluster. This overrides any
                                  security mode set in ``--extra-config``.
  --wait-for-dcos                 Wait for DC/OS after creating the cluster.
                                  This is equivalent to using "minidcos aws
                                  wait" after this command. "minidcos aws wait"
                                  has various options available and so may be
                                  more appropriate for your use case.
  --license-key FILE              This is ignored if using open source DC/OS. If
                                  using DC/OS Enterprise, this defaults to the
                                  value of the `DCOS_LICENSE_KEY_PATH`
                                  environment variable.
  --enable-spinner / --no-enable-spinner
                                  Whether to show a spinner animation. This
                                  defaults to true if stdout is a TTY.
  --genconf-dir DIRECTORY         Path to a directory that contains additional
                                  files for the DC/OS installer. All files from
                                  this directory will be copied to the "genconf"
                                  directory before running the DC/OS installer.
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
